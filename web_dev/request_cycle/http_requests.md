#What are some common HTTP status codes?
 *403: Code from an HTTP request means access to the resource is forbidden.
 *404: The 404 status code means the requested resource is no longer available or, more specifically, just not found.
 *500: When none of the other 500 error codes make sense, or if the programmer is just lazy and doesnâ€™t identify the specific problem, a 500 status code is returned.
 *503: The web server isn't available. 
 *504: The name says it all. A proxy server needs to communicate with a secondary web server, such as an apache server, and access to that server timed out.

 #What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
*In contrast, GET requests include all required data in the URL. Forms in HTML can use either method by specifying method="POST" or method="GET" (default) in the <form> element. The method specified determines how form data is submitted to the server. When the method is GET, all form data is encoded into the URL, appended to the action URL as query string parameters. With POST, form data appears within the message body of the HTTP request.

*You would use the POST request when you do not want any of the variables entered to appear in the address bar.

* A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing.
