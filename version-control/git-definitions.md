# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
   
   is a tool that enables the programmer to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in code.

   Version control is useful because it allows a single developer, or a group of developers view the entire history of changes to one or multiple files. It also allows these changes made by many people to be merged.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	
	A git branch is a copy of the project you are working on. This allows you or other collaborators to work on the project without jeopardising the master branch or its code. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	
	A commit is essentially making a save point for the project. The commit message describes the save point so you or others could easily determine what changes were made and why. A good commit message should be detailed and state what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

	Merge conflicts occur if competing changes are made to the same line of a file wor when a file is deleted that another person is attempting to edit.
